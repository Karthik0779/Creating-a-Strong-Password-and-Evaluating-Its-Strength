# 🔐 Task 6 – Password Security Analysis & Best Practices

## 📖 Overview
This task focuses on analyzing password strength, understanding common password attacks, and identifying best practices for creating secure passwords.  
The work includes:
- Creating multiple passwords of varying complexity.
- Testing them with [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com).
- Documenting results, scores, and feedback.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Password Meter** – for password strength scoring and feedback.
- Cybersecurity research resources and ethical hacking references.

## 📊 Key Findings
- 📏 Longer passwords with mixed characters significantly increase crack time.  
- ❌ Common words and predictable patterns weaken passwords.  
- 🔑 Unique passwords for each account prevent credential stuffing attacks.  
- 🛡 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security.  

## 💡 Recommendations
1. Use **12+ characters** for general accounts, **16+ characters** for sensitive accounts.  
2. Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
3. Avoid **common words**, phrases, and predictable substitutions.  
4. Enable **multi-factor authentication** wherever possible.  
5. Use a **password manager** for generating and storing secure passwords.
