#### Tips Learned from the Evaluation



&nbsp;    After creating and testing multiple passwords using passwordmeter.com, I observed the following key points:



1. Length has the biggest impact – Increasing password length greatly boosts resistance to brute-force attacks.



2\. Character variety matters – Adding uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases complexity and score.



3\. Common words reduce strength drastically – Even with symbols, passwords like P@ssword123 are still weak because attackers expect such substitutions.



4\. Randomness is critical – Unrelated words, numbers, and symbols make passwords harder to guess.



5\. Passphrases are a good balance – They can be long, memorable, and secure if chosen randomly (e.g., River$Piano77\_Eagle).



6\. Unique passwords protect against chain attacks – Using the same password for multiple accounts increases risk after a breach.



7\. Testing helps identify weak spots – Running passwords through a strength checker reveals predictable patterns and low complexity.



8\. Extra security with MFA – Even a strong password benefits from multi-factor authentication for critical accounts.



9\. Password managers simplify security – They allow the use of truly random, long passwords without memorization.



10\. Attackers are smarter now – Modern cracking tools can guess leetspeak and common substitutions, so creativity is important.
