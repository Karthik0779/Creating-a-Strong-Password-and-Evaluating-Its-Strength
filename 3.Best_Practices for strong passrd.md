After creating, testing, and evaluating multiple passwords of varying complexity using \*\*passwordmeter.com, I have identified the following best practices for building secure passwords that are resistant to common attacks:



1\.  Use a minimum of 12–16 characters



&nbsp;  > The longer the password, the more combinations an attacker must try.

&nbsp;  > For highly sensitive accounts, aim for \*\*20+ characters.



2\.  Include all four character types



&nbsp;  1.Uppercase letters (A–Z)

&nbsp;  2. Lowercase letters (a–z)

&nbsp;  3. Numbers\*\* (0–9)

&nbsp;  4. Special symbols (!, @, #, \\$, %, \&, etc.)



3\.  Avoid common words, names, and phrases



&nbsp;  > Examples to avoid: “password”, “iloveyou”, “admin123”, “welcome”.



4\.  Avoid predictable patterns



&nbsp;  > Do not use sequences like `qwerty`, `asdfgh`, `123456`.

&nbsp;  > Avoid simple substitutions like “P\\@ssw0rd” — modern cracking tools handle these easily.



5\.  Make passwords unique for every account



&nbsp;  > Prevents attackers from using one compromised password to access multiple accounts.



6\.  Use passphrases for memorability



&nbsp;  > Combine unrelated words with symbols and numbers, e.g., `Sun$et\_Mountain!42`.



7\.  Change passwords regularly for critical accounts



&nbsp;  > Banking, email, and work accounts should be updated every 3–6 months.



8\.  Use a password manager



&nbsp;  > Generates and securely stores strong, unique passwords.

&nbsp;  > Prevents the need to memorize multiple complex passwords.



9\.  Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)



&nbsp;   > Even if a password is compromised, MFA provides a second layer of protection.



10\.  Avoid personal information



&nbsp;    > Don’t use birthdays, pet names, phone numbers, or any data that can be found on social media.



11\.  Don’t reuse old passwords



&nbsp;   > Attackers may try previous passwords in case of repeated breaches.



12\. Test password strength before using



&nbsp;    > Use trusted tools like \[passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com) to identify weaknesses.







Conclusion:

By following these best practices, passwords become significantly more resistant to brute-force, dictionary, and social engineering attacks. Combining long length, character diversity, and MFA ensures maximum protection for online accounts.
