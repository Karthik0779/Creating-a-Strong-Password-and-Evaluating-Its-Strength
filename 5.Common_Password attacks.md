During my research for this task, I explored the most frequently used password attack techniques, how they work, and how to protect against them:



1\. Brute Force Attack\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Description: Systematically tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.

&nbsp;  \* Example: Trying “aaaaaa”, “aaaaab”, “aaaaac”… until success.

&nbsp;  \* Prevention: Use long passwords (12+ characters) with mixed character types.



2\. Dictionary Attack



&nbsp;  \* Description: Uses a precompiled list of words, phrases, and common variations to guess passwords.

&nbsp;  \* Example: Trying words like “apple”, “summer2024”, “p\\@ssword”.

&nbsp;  \* Prevention: Avoid dictionary words and predictable modifications.



3\. Credential Stuffing



&nbsp;  \* Description: Uses stolen username/password combinations from one breach to log into other websites.

&nbsp;  \* Example: If your social media password is leaked, attackers try it on your email or bank account.

&nbsp;  \* Prevention: Use unique passwords for each account.



4\. Phishing



&nbsp;  \* Description: Tricks users into entering passwords on fake login pages or via fraudulent emails.

&nbsp;  \* Example: An email pretending to be your bank asking to “verify your account”.

&nbsp;  \* Prevention: Verify links before clicking and enable MFA.



5\. Keylogging



&nbsp;  \* Description: Malicious software records every keystroke typed, including passwords.

&nbsp;  \* Example: A hidden program logs everything you type.

&nbsp;  \* Prevention: Keep systems updated, use antivirus tools, and avoid unknown downloads.



6\. Shoulder Surfing



&nbsp;  \* Description: Observing someone entering their password in public or through cameras.

&nbsp;  \* Example: Someone watching you type your phone PIN at a café.

&nbsp;  \* Prevention: Shield screens and be aware of surroundings.



7\. Rainbow Table Attack



&nbsp;  \* Description: Uses precomputed tables of hashed passwords to match stored password hashes.

&nbsp;  \* \*\*Example: Matching MD5 hash “5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99” to “password”.

&nbsp;  \* \*\*Prevention: Websites should use salted hashes; as a user, choose long, complex passwords.



8\. Social Engineering



&nbsp;  \* Description: Manipulating or deceiving people into revealing their passwords.

&nbsp;  \* Example: Pretending to be IT support and asking for login details.

&nbsp;  \* Prevention: Never share passwords with anyone, even supposed officials.



9\. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack



&nbsp;  \* Description: Intercepting communications to capture login credentials.

&nbsp;  \* Example: Using unsecured public Wi-Fi to steal login information.

&nbsp;  \* Prevention: Use HTTPS websites and avoid logging in over public Wi-Fi without a VPN.



&nbsp;  Summary:

Strong, unique passwords, combined with multi-factor authentication (MFA), significantly reduce the risk of these attacks. Awareness of these methods allows better protection of personal and professional accounts.
